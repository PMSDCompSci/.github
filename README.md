## How It Works

1. Students express what type of project(s) they would like to work on and what programming languages they're fluent in.
2. Whichever project is most voted for is chosen as the main project, and members are split up into various sections.
3. Students will learn their required language(s) and gain experience working in a group alongside using both Git and GitHub.
4. Leadership positions are tested or voted for depending on the role (Ex. Management requires voting, teaching requires testing).
5. Management will keep track of progress and dates will be adjusted accordingly in order to get projects done on time.
